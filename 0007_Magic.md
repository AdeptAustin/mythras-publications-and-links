# Magic and Powers

Games Masters who want to include magic and/or superpowers in their games will find some basic rules for doing so in this section. It is always best to ensure that everyone involved in the game is happy for magic or superpowers to be included, and always give some thought to the kind of game it may produce.

## How Powers Work

Casting a spell or using a superpower usually requires the expenditure of some form of energy drawn from a pool of points. The size of this pool is equal to the character's POW characteristic, and in the case of magicians the pool is known as Magic Points; and for superheroes, Power Points. Using magic or powers costs a certain number of points that is deducted from this pool, and when the pool is empty, no more magic can be cast, or powers used, until it recovers.

Magic recovers at a number of points equal to the character's Healing Rate per hour until they reach a level equal to the character's POW. This assumes that the character is can rest fully, participating in no other activities, , and is not recovering from fatigue or injury. If so, the Games Master can increase the time taken to recover Magic/Power Points, or reduce the Healing Rate.

For superpowers, Power Points recover at a rate of one per full minute of rest, but characters can also spend a Luck Point to immediately regain 1d4+1 lost Power Points up to their maximum.

### Casting Spells

Spells are cast using the Magic skill; without it, magic is simply not possible. Preparing and casting a spell requires one Action and a successful Magic roll. If the roll fails, the spell does not work and must be readied and attempted again later. If the roll succeeds, the spell works, and Magic Points are deducted from the Magic Point pool.

### Using Superpowers

Superhero characters find that their superpower is always working, and so needs no roll to use or Power Point expenditure; however, if trying to Boost a power, then there is a Power Point cost.

## Beginning Powers and Learning New Ones

### Magicians

Magicians begin with 1d4+1 spells, all of which are cast using the Magic skill. The player and Games Master should consult on which spells are available and how the character came by them. For example, the character may have been an apprentice to a local magician, or may have learned magic at their mother's knee.

More spells can be learned, but it costs 3 Experience Rolls to learn a new spell, and takes a week of dedicated study and practice. New spells must be learned from a teacher or a reliable source (such as a scroll or grimoire designed to teach a new spell).

### Superheroes

For superheroes, the Games Master and player should decide how the character came by his or her powers, and what the source of the power is (for example, it may be a suit of special armor, abilities gained through exposure to cosmic rays, or a genetic mutation).

Superheroes start with a number of core powers determined by POW plus another Characteristic based on the source of the powers: CON for altered physiology (mutation, alien species, experimentation) or INT for technology or skill-based powers (cybernetics, battle suits, intense training, and so on). See the table, below.

A core power can be exchanged for two Boosts that can be applied to any core power. A character may also take up to two Limits from the list starting in the Super Powers section, with one providing a bonus Boost, or two granting a bonus core power. A selection of powers and example Boosts are listed in the [Super Powers](0007_Magic.md?id=superpowers) section.

#### Super Powers Table

| **POW+ Characteristic** | **Core Powers** |
|:--|:-:|
| 12 or less          | 1           |
| 13-20               | 2           |
| 21-30               | 3           |
| 31-40               | 4           |
| 40+                 | 5           |


## Magic

Whenever a character wishes to use a spell, they make a roll against their Magic skill. Casting takes a single turn, but the amount of Magic Points used and whether the spell is successful depends on the result of the roll..

If the Magic roll is a...

- **Critical Success:** the spell's Magic Point cost is zero.
- **Success:** the caster loses 1 Magic Point, and the spell works
- **Failure:** the caster loses 1 Magic Point, but the spell does not work.
- **Fumble:** the caster loses 1d3 Magic Points for the spell and the spell fails.

Due to their minor or petty nature, all Magic spells have a default Intensity and Magnitude of 1.


### Limits to Magic Capacity

Characters have no actual limit to the number of Magic spells they can learn, provided that the Games Master permits them to have access to new ones.

### Spells

Spells are defined by various traits defining the effects of the spell and any particular limitations. Every spell is different with some having fewer traits than others.

### Duration of Spells

Unless a spell has either the Concentration or Instant traits it has a natural duration which lasts the entire scene or action for which the spell was used. A few spells have custom durations noted in the spell's definition.

### Magic Traits

Magic Traits are as follows:

- **Concentration:** The spell's effects remain in place if the caster continues to concentrate on maintaining it. Concentration requires the caster to be free of all physical and mental distractions: any such disturbance interrupts the concentration, resulting in the spell's immediate dismissal.
- **Instant:** The spell's effects happen immediately. It has no duration.
- **Ranged:** Spells with the Ranged trait can be cast at a distance of up to the character's Magic score in metres. The caster must know the location of the target, such as 'hiding behind the door': if they are unable to directly see or sense the target of the spell, then the Magic roll becomes one grade harder.
- **Resist (Endurance, Evade, Willpower):** Any spell that is not readily accepted by a target can be actively resisted using either Endurance, Evade or Willpower, as determined by this trait. To successfully resist a spell, the target must win an Opposed Roll of the relevant skill against the caster's Magic casting result. If the target fails in the roll, then the spell takes effect as normal. Note that resisting is usually a passive action if Endurance or Willpower are the being used. If a spell requires the target to Evade, then it costs an Action Point to make the Evade attempt. Targets without Action Points to spend in evading will therefore be powerless against the spell's effect.
- **Touch:** The caster must be in physical contact with the target whilst the spell is cast. If a target is intent on resisting physical contact, then the caster will most likely fail to complete his spell unless some specific circumstance prevents the target's withdrawal, such as surprise or the Grip special effect. A touch spell merely needs to contact the target or its carried accouterments to work.


## Spell Descriptions

### Alarm

_Special Duration_

Casting Alarm on a location such as a room or small clearing creates a temporary psychic bond between the area and the caster. If the area is accessed by a living creature with a SIZ greater than 1, the caster is automatically made aware that something has transgressed no matter how great the distance. The Alarm is usually a distinct tingling sensation or mental twinge which will awaken the caster. Alarm can also be used on an individual object, triggering when touched or moved.

### Avert

_Instant, Ranged_

Avert is used to dismiss another spell within range. Avert can be cast reactively to neutralize offensive spells, by using the Counter Magic Reactive Action.

### Befuddle

_Ranged, Resist (Willpower)_

Befuddle causes confusion within the mind of a corporeal target. The subject of the spell has difficulty thinking straight, forgetting where it is, what it is doing and why – often lapsing into disassociated lines of thought. Befuddled targets can still act in self defense, but cannot initiate any constructive activity until the spell ends. Any sort of attack or threatening action instantly breaks the spell, whether or not it was directed specifically at the befuddled target.

### Bladesharp

_Touch_

Bladesharp is cast on edged and piercing melee weapons. It increases the damage of a weapon by one dice step and incidentally leaves the edge honed after the spell concludes. This spell is often used on tools such as logging axes, plows, and razors. Thus, casting this spell on a dagger increases it to 1d6+1 damage, whereas the same spell on a great axe would increase it to 2d8+2 damage. (1d4→1d6→1d8→1d10→2d6→2d8→2d10).

### Bludgeon

_Touch_

Bludgeon is like Bladesharp but used on weapons and tools that deal blunt-force trauma rather than cutting or piercing damage. It is normally used to aid with threshing grain, fulling wool, or similar heavy-duty work.

### Breath

_Touch_

Breath permits the recipient to hold their breath for an extended period, so that they can temporarily venture into harmful environments, such as underwater; or atmospheres tainted by rock dust, gases, smoke, or poisons. The spell lasts for a maximum of half the caster's POW in minutes, during which time the recipient cannot speak, or the breath is lost, and they must immediately begin to breathe from their environment suffering any present risks - be that asphyxiation, drowning, poisoning, etc.

<summary>* Community Errata</summary>

_**Breath**_

_The original spell description was as follows: "Breath permits the recipient to hold their breath for an extended period, so that they can temporarily venture into harmful environments, such as underwater; or atmospheres tainted by rock dust, gases, smoke, or poisons. The spell lasts for a maximum of half the caster's POW in minutes, during which time the recipient cannot speak, or the breath is lost, and they immediately begin to asphyxiate (or become poisoned)."_

_This could be read as an offensive effect triggered at the spell's end, which seems counter to the authors' intention and the pattern of such spells as utilities rather than weapons. Hence the Community Errata edit above. We will update this text should the original authors revise the rule as written._

</details>

### Calm

_Ranged, Resist (Willpower)_

Calm attempts to dampen down the passions or the target, perhaps ensuring that a lovesick paramour doesn't press his suit, a frightened rival doesn't scream for help or that weapons are not drawn in anger. A calmed person is not otherwise mentally affected; Thus, any sort of assault or threatening action still permits the target to defend themselves and even attack, albeit they will do so in a calm and level-headed manner.

### Chill

_Instant, Touch_

Chill dramatically reduces the temperature of small objects (no larger than the caster's hand) down to the temperature of ice water. Useful for rapidly cooling hot items, chilling drinks, and so forth. The spell does not freeze an object and neither does it cause any damage to its structure: it merely renders it very cold.

### Darkness

_Concentration, Ranged_

Darkness creates an area of shadow, equal to POW in square metres, which suppresses all light within it. This is enough volume to fill a modest room, a length of corridor or form a small cloud if cast outside. All non-magical light, including sunlight, passing into or present within the boundary is reduced to the equivalent of a dim glow.

### Disruption

_Instant, Ranged, Resist (Endurance)_

Disruption is used for damaging or disassembling physical objects without the need for tools. It is commonly employed to drive off or kill living creatures, such as birds or vermin. When successfully cast, Disruption inflicts 1d3 damage to a single random Hit Location or the overall Hit Points of an object. In both cases the damage ignores any armor or natural protection.

### Extinguish

_Instant, Ranged_

Extinguish immediately quenches flames and small fires of modest size and heat. It is useful for dousing candles, lanterns, torches, or small cook fires, but it will not work on magical or larger, more ferocious conflagrations such as pyres, burning houses or dragon flames.

### Find (X)

_Concentration, Ranged, Resist (Special)_

Find has many variations; always specific and learned as separate spells. Some common examples are given below. It works by attuning to the natural emanations of a creature or thing, alerting the caster to its presence within the spell's range. Find can be blocked by dense or thick materials such as metal, or earth and stone at least one metre thick. The spell cannot discern emotions or thoughts. 

- *Find Arrows*: Locates ammunition shot by hunters, which miss their target.
- *Find Flaw*: Identifies any flaws in an object, such as hidden imperfections or physical damage.
- *Find Livestock*: Locates a particular type of animal. Can be resisted with Willpower.
- *Find Loot*: Locates precious metals and gems.
- *Find Object*: Locates a lost personal possession.
- *Find Sickness*: Identifies the existence of disease and illness, whether magical or mundane.

### Firearrow

_Touch_

Firearrow causes all missiles thrown or fired by the recipient to burst into flame when released. Ostensibly created to act as a signal flare, it has since evolved into a combat magic. Missiles under its effect add an additional 1d3 damage but are extinguished if they impale flesh. Those that strike flammable material have a chance equal to the caster's Folk Magic skill of setting alight whatever they lodge in, such as wooden shields, thatched roofs and so on. Wooden ammunition is consumed as part of the spell.

### Fireblade

_Touch_

Fireblade like Firearrow but is instead cast on hand tools and melee weapons. The original purpose of the spell is to sterilize surgical equipment, aid in slash and burn agriculture or provide illumination during darkness without the need to carry an additional light source. If cast on a weapon it inflicts an additional 1d3 damage, and damage and has the chance of setting flammable materials alight if held to them for several rounds (see Fire in the Game System Section). Wooden hafted weapons under the effects of Fireblade will be consumed as part of the spell.

### Glue

_Touch_

Glue cements together two solid, inanimate objects for the duration of the spell, for example a cartwheel to its axle or a door to its frame. Whilst under the effects of the spell the items, no matter how disparate, cannot be parted unless something actively tries to wrench them apart. In this circumstance the spell has a Brawn skill equal to five times the caster's POW and fails when a superior Brawn is set against it, defeating it in an Opposed Roll. Once the spell concludes or fails, the items part completely unharmed.

### Heal

_Instant, Touch_

Heal has several different effects depending on the nature of the ailment it is being used on. If the subject is suffering from a minor complaint such as a headache, back pain, hangover, cold, warts and so on, then the symptoms are immediately lifted. Cast on a location suffering a Minor Wound it restores all lost Hit Points instantly. Against Serious or Major Wounds no Hit Points are recovered. However, the spell will stabilize locations, stop all bleeding and prevent imminent death from inattention.

### Ignite

_Instant, Ranged_

Ignite only works on flammable inorganic matter, causing a small object or hand-sized area to burst into flame. Depending on what was set alight, once burning, the flames may then spread unless quenched or countered in some way. This spell is normally used to light candles, torches, or lanterns from afar. It can also be used to start a camp or cooking fire in adverse conditions, such as using damp kindling or in strong winds.

### Knock

_Instant, Touch_

Knock magically unfastens any device that is currently secured with a mechanical bar or lock. It does not work on magically locked objects, only mundane ones. The spell only affects a single fastening, so if there are several locks and bars securing the object, the spell will need to be recast for each one.

### Light

_Concentration, Ranged_

Light must be cast on an inanimate object (this could be a branch, sword blade, spear point, torch and so on). It produces enough light to illuminate an area as though with a lantern. It can also be cast directly against a Darkness spell to counter it. In this case both spells are consumed, leaving the ambient light to illuminate the area.

### Lock

_Special Duration, Touch_

Lock magically secures any device that already has a mechanical bar or lock present. A Locked device can be opened only by the caster and cannot be picked by mundane means (such as by a thief using lock-picks) since the magic renders the mechanism immobile; however, it could still be forced open by breaking the object the lock is set into. The magic remains in place until opened by the caster, after which the device must be subject to a further casting of Lock to restore the enchantment. The Magic Point used to cast Lock does not recover until the spell is dismissed or concludes naturally.

### Phantasm

_Concentration, Ranged_

Phantasm allows the caster to weave together insubstantial or near weightless objects so that they take a shape or ghostly form. Thus, a spectral figure could be woven from a naturally occurring mist, or a face formed in a pile of dead leaves. Beyond this the spell has little effect, save to frighten, intrigue, or disconcert those that view it.

### Sleep

_Resist (Endurance), Touch_

Sleep sends its recipient into a deep, peaceful sleep. It has no effect on creatures with a SIZ greater than the caster's POW. Unless the target resists, it slumbers for a number of hours equal to the half the caster's POW. However, the spell takes 1d3 Rounds to take effect before the target falls unconscious. Any attempt to cast this spell in a combat situation automatically fails.

### Vigor

_Touch_

Vigor makes the recipient feel alive and energetic, being used to offset the effects of strenuous physical labor. For the spell's duration, all Fatigue effects gained from laborious activity are ignored (but return on the spell's dismissal).

### Witchsight

_Ranged, Resist (Willpower)_

Witchsight allows the caster to see active magic, enchanted items, and invisible entities (although such things are simply shadowy representations) that lie within range and line of sight. It can also penetrate illusions or discern the true guise of shapeshifted creatures. Beings which wish to remain hidden or disguised must win an Opposed Roll of their Willpower versus the casting roll.

## Superpowers

The superpowers included here provide a core power that is either always active or can be activated at will. Core powers can also have special stunts called Boosts that require the expenditure of Power Points to activate. A character that reaches 0 Power Points cannot use Boosts or any core powers with a cost until Power Points are regained.

Limits are optional disadvantages that can be placed on a character, core powers, or Boosts. Each Limit details the circumstances in which it applies, and the Games Master must approve any Limit chosen.

A character may also take up to two Limits from the list below, with one providing a bonus Boost, or two granting a bonus core power.


## Powers Descriptions

### Animation

Animate 2 cubic metres of non-living materials within POW in metres to create a construct, usually in a humanoid form. The cost in Power Points is equal to the armor value of the highest value material used, which is also the base armor value of the construct. Constructs have a base STR of 2d6+16 (23), SIZ of 1d6+12 (15), and a DEX of 1d6+8 (11), with Hit Points determined as normal. The character must use actions to direct the construct and it uses the character's skills for any rolls. If the construct takes a Serious Wound to the chest or abdomen, make an opposed Endurance check against the attack roll. If unsuccessful the construct immediately collapses. Example Armor Values/ Power Point Cost:

| **Armor Values**          | **Power Point Cost** |
|:--|:-:|
| Plastic or Soft Wood  | 2                |
| Concrete or Hard Wood | 4                |
| Soft Metal or Stone   | 6                |
| Hard Metal            | 8                |

**Boost:** Spend 2 Power Points to instantly move the construct to another source of the same material within POW in metres.

### Combat Expert

Choose one type of combat expertise from the list below, plus one for every boost spent.

- Melee expertise grants one bonus Action Point that can only be used defensively, and effective weapon size is increased by one step for attacks and parries. 
- Ranged expertise reduces the situational modifiers by two grades instead of one when aiming and reload time of ranged weapons is reduced by one.

Boost: Spend 2 Power Points to gain an extra Action Point that can only be used to Attack or Ready Weapon.

### Durability

Hit points are calculated using CON+SIZ+POW and Healing Rate is calculated using CON+ half POW, rounded up.

**Boost:** Spend 2 Power Points as a free action to regain Healing Rate in lost Hit Points or a lost level of Fatigue.

### Elemental Control

Choose a specific material or type of energy. Spend an action to control up to half POW in cubic metres of the element anywhere within POW metres. May alter the basic form or create complex shapes with a successful Craft (specific element) check. Upon creation choose either a close combat attack or a ranged attack. The close combat attack has a reach of Very Long and the ranged attack has a range of 8/24/100, then choose any two Combat Effects. Damage and force/size is determined by POW: 8 or less: 1d4/T, 9-12: 1d6/S, 13-15: 1d8/M, 16-18: 1d10/M, 19+: 1d12/L.

**Boost:** Spend 3 Power Points to sheathe the character in the element for the scene. Solid materials gain an armor value equal to one fifth POW, rounded up. If it is energy, unarmed attacks inflict extra damage equal to the base damage of the power and unarmed attacks against the character suffer the same damage to the limb used.

### Energy Blast

Fire blasts of a specific type of energy out to a range of 10/30/120 and choose two Combat Effects to apply at time of creation. Damage and force are determined by the character's POW: 8 or less: 1d6/S, 9-12: 1d8/M, 13-15: 1d10/M, 16-18: 1d12/L, 19+: 2d6/L. To hit, the character rolls against either an applicable Combat Style for the power or uses Unarmed.

**Boost:** Spend 2 Power Points and an action to inflict +1d6 damage on the next energy blast attack.

### Enhanced Reactions

Gain a bonus to initiative rolls equal to the critical range of Athletics skill and never end up prone after using Evade.

**Boost:** Spend 1 Power Point to make the next Athletics or Acrobatics check one difficulty grade easier.

### Enhanced Speed

Increase base movement by a multiplier based on DEX+POW. Maximum speed outside of combat is equal to ten times the modified movement in kilometres per hour.

DEX+POW: 12 or less: x2, 13-24: x3, 25-36: x4, 37+: x5.

**Boost:** Spend 2 Power Points to gain an extra Action Point that can only be used to Change Range, Move, or Outmaneuver.

### Enhanced Strength

Damage bonus is calculated using STR+SIZ+POW and maximum lift is determined by the character's STR+POW: 12 or less: 1 ton, 13-24: 2 tons, 25-36: 3 tons, 37+: 5 tons. Unarmed attacks count as large size and melee and thrown objects have their size or force increased by one.

**Boost:** Spend 3 Power Points to double maximum lift for one action or task.

### Flight

Gain a flight speed equal to POW in metres, with a maximum speed outside of combat equal to ten times movement in kilometres per hour.

**Boost:** Spend 2 Power Points to use the core power for a different sense.

### Inherent armor

Provides an armor value to all locations equal to one third of CON, rounded up. Characters may choose to reduce the value of a location by up to two points to add it to another location; for example, lowering the value of their right arm to add to their head.

**Boost:** When struck by an attack, gain an extra armor point against it for each 1 Power Point spent.

### Life Support

Gain immunity to two environmental conditions or biological requirements.

**Boost:** Gain immunity to two additional environments or requirements.

### Lucky

Calculate base Luck Points with CHA and half of POW, rounded up.

**Boost:** When doubles are rolled spend 3 Power Points to gain a temporary Luck Point which must be used by the end of the scene.

### Regeneration

Regain one Hit Point to all wounded locations at the start of each round if the location has not sustained a Major Wound.

**Boost:** Enter a healing trance and spend 1 Power Point per hour to regain one Hit Point to a location with a Major Wound.

### Savant

Choose three skills with one characteristic in common and checks with them are one grade easier.

**Boost:** When using a specialized skill such as Craft or Science that is also a Savant skill, spend 3 Power Points to gain a specialty the character doesn't have for one task at the same level as the Savant skill.

### Teleport

Teleport to any visible point within POW in metres as a move action.

**Boost:** Spend 2 Power Points to teleport up to half of POW in metres, rounded up, as a free action.

### Vaporous Form

As an action turn into a cloud of vapor or fine particles that is incapable of interacting with the physical world but is immune to physical attacks. Gain a flying speed equal to one- third POW in metres and pass through openings of any size. Energy based attacks inflict half damage to the character's Power Points. If reduced to 0 Power Points the character returns to a solid state and must make a Hard Endurance check of fall unconscious for 1d6+1 minutes.

**Boost:** Spend 3 Power Point to solidify one hit location for one action.

## Limits

### Activation Cost

The character spends 2 Power Points to activate a core power or increases a boost's cost by 2 Power Points. Alternately a continuous power costs 1 Power Point at the start of each turn to maintain.

### External Power Source

The source of the character's powers is an artefact or device. If small or handheld, the source is vulnerable to Special Effects such as Disarm Weapon or Take Weapon. If it's large, it requires at least one minute to don or activate before the powers can be used.

### Fatal Flaw

The character must consume or contact a substance every four hours or suffer a level of Fatigue. A successful Endurance check can stave this off, but the difficulty of this check increases by one grade for each additional four hours the requirement isn't met.

### Limited Control

With actions involving the power or boost, the character's range of critical failure increases to 90-00.

### Limited Power

The power or boost only works under specific conditions or has some reduced effect determined by the Games Master.

### Physical Limitation

The character has a persistent limiting condition, such as blindness, permanent Hit Point loss to a location, or reduced mobility.

### Vulnerability

The character takes double damage from a specific form of attack. Alternately the character must make Hard Endurance checks each turn when 5 metres of a specific substance or suffers a level of Fatigue.
