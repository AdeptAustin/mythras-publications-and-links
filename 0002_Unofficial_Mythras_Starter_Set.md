# Unofficial Mythras Starter Sets

---
## Core Mythras

Core _Mythras_ is just that, the core. One of the most flexible and rewarding systems out there, we can't wait for you to get started. This is a starter set for core _Mythras_. Everything here is completely free.

Learn more about the different rulesets [here](0007_Daughter_RPGs.md)
### Rules

#### Mythras Imperative

An 80 page ORC-licensed version of the core system, includes char-gen, combat, Folk Magic & Superpowers and vehicles. Don't think that this is just a cut down version of the rules. There's a lot in here that can be used to run Mythras in almost any setting.

### Adventures

#### Shrine of the Traitor Gods

A short scenario designed to introduce those brand new to roleplaying to _Mythras_. This is set in the _Meeros_ setting which, while not a default setting, is used extensively in examples in the core rulebook. Use the pre-generated Characters included with the scenario and the included basic rules to get used to the system.

#### Sariniya's Curse

Another adventure with pre-generated characters in the Meeros setting. This one's a little longer and more difficult. Play this one using the _Mythras Imperative_ or the _Mythras_ Core rules. Either way, continue using the pregenerated characters as everyone gets comfortable with the expanded rules compared to the basic ones in _Shrine of the Traitor Gods_.

#### Meeros Falling

Another adventure set in the _Meeros_ setting following the events in the Core Rules. This is a great adventure for playerâ€™s to finally create their own characters and even interact with some characters they may have played before.
